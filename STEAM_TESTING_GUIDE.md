   - Ensure Steam ID is exactly 17 digits
   - No spaces or special characters

2. **"Failed to fetch Steam profile"**

   - Check if API key is correct
   - Ensure Steam profile is public
   - Verify internet connection

3. **"Failed to fetch Steam games"**

   - Profile might be private
   - API key might have insufficient permissions
   - Steam API might be temporarily down

4. **"No multiplayer games found"**
   - User might not own multiplayer games
   - Games might not be properly categorized
   - This is normal for some users

#### **Debug Tips:**

1. **Check Console Logs:**

   ```bash
   flutter run --verbose
   ```

2. **Test with Different Steam IDs:**

   - Try with a friend's public Steam profile
   - Use Steam's official test accounts

3. **Verify API Key:**
   - Test API key at [steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
   - Ensure it's not expired

### **Step 7: Production Testing**

Once basic testing works:

1. **Test with multiple users**
2. **Test with different game libraries**
3. **Test error handling (invalid credentials)**
4. **Test network failure scenarios**
5. **Verify privacy (Steam IDs not sent to server)**
